# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year Computer Science student at the Warsaw University of Technology.

I speak Polish (native), English (C1 - CAE certificate) *y un poco EspaÃ±ol*.

I am passionate about Sofware Engineering, C++, Python, as well as the applications of Artificial Intelligence and many other topics.

I am also a novice Emacs enthusiast.
